## Description

The todo-list app is a simple but very practical project that was created for the youcode course. It was based on React.js. When writing code, I put special emphasis on the use of accepted conventions and good practices.

The correctness of my work is supervised by [Krzysztof Dąbrowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dabrowskisoftware) - an experienced Senior Software Engineer.

## Technologies

- Semantic HTML
- BEM
- CSS
- Grid
- Media queries
- ES6+ features
- Immutability
- React.js
- Create react app
- Webpack
- Babel.js

## Instruction

Enter the task you want to add to the task list. Click the "Dodaj zadanie" button and you'll see it at the bottom of the app as the next item in the list.

If you want to select the task as done, click on the green icon. If you want to change your mind, click the green icon again.

You can use the "Ukryj/pokaż ukończone" button to hide or show completed tasks in the list, as well as the "Ukończ wszystkie" button to mark all tasks as completed.

If you want to delete your task, click on the red icon.

## Additional information

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
